# Talk: Graph to Greatness

## Abstract
Graph databases are changing the NoSQL database landscape in startling new ways. Fraud detection, impact analysis, and recommendation systems are only a few examples of real-world applications made possible with graph technology.

Neo4j leads the industry with its powerful open source graph database platform.

With compelling features and the elegant CYPHER query language, Neo4j provides tools to tackle a wide range of problems unsolvable with traditional approaches.

In this talk, you’ll learn about the advantages of graph-based solutions, get a taste of the expressive query language at the heart of Neo4j, and pick up valuable tips to help you get started applying graphs to your own ideas.
